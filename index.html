    <h1 id="heading">So you want to learn computer programming...</h1>
    <br>
    <p>If you're just getting started with computer programming it can be tricky knowing where to start and which language to choose as your focus. If you're about to cut down a tree which tool would you choose... a hatchet or a hand saw? would you cut from the top down or sideways through the trunk? This analogy might not fit but it does tackle the same idea of needing to approach the specific project with the right tools and the right approach.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Below is a comprehensive list of questions to help you decide which language is best for you and for your
      project. Hope this helps and happy coding!</p>

    <h2>We recommend: Javascript</h2>
    <p><span id="language1-js">JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that powers the interactive features and dynamic behavior of websites. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can be run directly in web browsers without the need for additional plugins or installations. JavaScript is primarily used for client-side web development, allowing developers to create interactive web pages and enhance user experience.
      <br><br>
    One of the key strengths of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate and modify the content of a web page in real-time. It provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries that enable developers to handle user events, create animations, validate forms, make AJAX requests, and dynamically update the page without requiring a full page reload.
      <br><br>
    JavaScript is also increasingly used on the server-side through frameworks like Node.js, which allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications using JavaScript for both the client and server sides. This versatility makes JavaScript a valuable skill for full-stack web development.
      <br><br>
    Furthermore, JavaScript has a large and vibrant developer community with extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks available. This ecosystem provides developers with a wide range of tools and resources to accelerate development, solve common challenges, and create powerful web applications.
      <br><br>
    Overall, choosing JavaScript as a coding language offers the following benefits:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
    <li>Enables interactive and dynamic web pages with real-time updates.</li>
    <li>Widely supported by all major web browsers.</li>
    <li>Can be used for both client-side and server-side development.</li>
    <li>Large and active community support.</li>
    <li>Abundance of libraries, frameworks, and resources available.</li>
    <li>Excellent career prospects and job opportunities in web development.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>We recommend: C#</h2>
    <p><span id="language2-cs">C# (C Sharp) is a powerful and versatile programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for developing a variety of applications,
      including desktop, web, mobile, gaming, and enterprise software.
      <br><br>
      C# is part of the .NET framework, which provides a comprehensive set of libraries and tools for building robust and scalable applications.
      It offers a modern and object-oriented programming model with features such as strong typing, garbage collection, and automatic memory management.
      <br><br>
      One of the key strengths of C# is its ability to create Windows applications using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework.
      This allows developers to build visually appealing and interactive user interfaces with rich media support.
      <br><br>
      C# is also widely used for web development with frameworks like ASP.NET, which enables developers to create dynamic and data-driven web applications.
      Additionally, C# can be used for game development with the Unity engine, making it a popular choice among game developers.
      <br><br>
      Choosing C# as a coding language offers the following benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>Strong support for developing Windows applications with WPF.</li>
        <li>Extensive libraries and tools provided by the .NET framework.</li>
        <li>Ability to build web applications with frameworks like ASP.NET.</li>
        <li>Popular choice for game development using Unity.</li>
        <li>Integration with other Microsoft technologies and platforms.</li>
        <li>Excellent career prospects and job opportunities, especially in the Microsoft ecosystem.</li>
